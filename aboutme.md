In response to Canadaâ€™s Space Low Earth Orbit Architecture initiative (SpaceLEO), the University of Victoria Center for Aerospace Research (CfAR) has proposed the implementation and development of PolarLink a single CubeSat with the purpose of aiding research in the artic region. PolarLink requires the development of a communication system consisting of a radio transceiver and one or more patch antennas. Our team has been tasked with the development and initial testing of an S band patch antenna to facilitate the communication of the CubeSAT with multiple domestic and/or international commercial constellations, as well as several remote terminals across northern Canada. The patch antenna is to transmit and receive signals within the 2-4 GHz frequency range, also known as the S-band.
