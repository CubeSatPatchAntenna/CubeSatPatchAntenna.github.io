The finalized design is a square stacked patch hybrid feed antenna with corner truncation. It features a smaller lower (direct) patch and larger upper (coupled) patch which are proximity-coupled to facilitate a large bandwidth. An airgap which acts as a low-permittivity dielectric between the upper and lower substrate exists to further tune the patch coupling and increase bandwidth. The lower patch is fed directly via the inner conductor of a female SMA connector in alignment with the project requirements.
