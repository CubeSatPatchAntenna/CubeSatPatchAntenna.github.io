The S-Band CubeSat Patch Antenna development group consisted of a four-member team with responsibilities divided to utilize each memberâ€™s strengths and to maintain an efficient workflow. Duties were assigned at the start of the semester but were adjusted accordingly to meet with demands and delays. All work completed was done with the guidance of UVIC CfAR Space Division Manager Levente Buzas and UVIC Faculty Supervisor Dr. Levi Smith.
**Design Team**
| **Team Member** | **Role** | **Key Deliverables** | **Significance to Project** |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Darius Clayton | Antenna Modelling Lead | Developed initial and refined patch antenna designs in ANSYS HFSS based on project requirements. | Provided the foundational geometry for performance simulations, ensuring designs were physically realizable and aligned with specifications. |
| Logan Dring | Simulation and Optimization Lead | Conducted parametric sweeps in HFSS, varying patch dimensions, substrate properties, and feed positions to maximize gain, bandwidth, and impedance matching. | Enabled identification of the optimal design parameters, directly influencing final antenna efficiency and performance. |
| Jordan Bona | PCB Design and Fabrication Lead | Translated the optimal simulated design into an Altium PCB layout, ensuring manufacturability and adherence to design tolerances. | Produced a fabrication-ready design, bridging the gap between theoretical simulations and physical realization. |
| Jonathan Boyce | Testing and Validation Lead | Performed performance testing using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and anechoic chamber measurements; compared measured data with simulations. | Verified that the fabricated antenna met design specifications and documented real-world performance for validation purposes. |
